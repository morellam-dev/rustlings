# rustlings-solutions ðŸ¦€

Rustlings is a series of small exercises for first-time learners of the Rust programming language. This repo is forked from [the main Rustlings repository](/rust-lang/rustlings); it contains solutions to the Rustlings exercises, written by me, [@morellam-dev](/morellam-dev).
